# EDA-on-Retail-Sales
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Sales Data

## Project Description

In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about retail sales. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.

## Key Concepts and Challenges

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the retail sales dataset and perform necessary cleaning to prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand the distribution of the data.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques to identify seasonal patterns and long-term trends.
4. **Customer and Product Analysis**: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior to understand who the customers are and what they are buying.
5. **Visualization**: Present insights through visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to effectively communicate the findings.
6. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA to help the retail business make informed decisions.
